                Tailwind CSS and traditional CSS serve different purposes.
                Tailwind CSS is not inherently faster or slower than CSS;
                instead, it focuses on providing utility classNamees to expedite
                the development process. Whether Tailwind CSS is faster for your
                project depends on factors like your familiarity with the
                framework and your project's specific requirements.{" "}
